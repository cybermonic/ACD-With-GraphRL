NOOP
CybORG.Shared.Actions.Action.Sleep
    Do nothing, get a fresh Observation

FILE FEATURE UPDATE
CybORG.Shared.Actions.AbstractActions.Analyse
    Run "malware scan" on host provided
    Will return additional features 
        'Density' (float, 0-1) 
        'Signed' (bool) 
    for any files that it thinks are malicous 

PROCESS+SESSION DELETE
CybORG.Shared.Actions.AbstractActions.Remove
    Removes any non-priviledged shells 
    (deletes the process and session nodes)
    Code seems to suggest it only deletes "suspicious PIDs" but
    unclear how this determination is made 

PROCESS+SESSION+FILE+CONNECTION DELETE
CybORG.Shared.Actions.AbstractActions.Restore
    Removes all nodes/edges that have been added since the
    beginning of the sim. 
    Note: may want to add 'new' feature to nodes to determine
    which have been added and which persist between wipes?
    Effective, but huge penalty

PROCESS+SESSION FEATURE UPDATE
CybORG.Shared.Actions.AbstractActions.Monitor
    Determines which procs/sessions are suspicious (I think?)
    Pretty sure this needs to be called before Remove

PROCESS CREATE
CybORG.Shared.Actions.AbstractActions.Misinform
    Selects a random decoy from the below list to create
